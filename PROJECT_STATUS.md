# Local Sales Finder - Project Status

## Project Overview
A web application that helps users find and navigate to local sales events (garage sales, estate sales, etc.) in their area. The app shows sales on an interactive map and provides a detailed list view with navigation options.

## Current Features
- [x] Interactive map showing user location and nearby sales
- [x] Detailed list view of sales with:
  - Event type with emoji
  - Description
  - Distance from user
  - Address
  - Navigation button
- [x] Dark mode support
- [x] Synchronized map markers and list items
- [x] Click-to-scroll functionality from map to list
- [x] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [x] Real-time location-based filtering
- [x] Custom event types with emoji support

## Planned Features
- [ ] Search and filtering options
- [ ] Save favorite/interesting sales
- [ ] Share sales with others
- [ ] User-submitted sales
- [ ] Sale date/time management
- [ ] Push notifications for nearby sales
- [ ] Image support for sales
- [ ] Route planning for multiple sales
- [ ] Categories/tags for sales
- [ ] Sale ratings and reviews

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, large ecosystem, and efficient rendering
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for:
  - Rapid UI development
  - Consistent styling
  - Dark mode support
  - Responsive design
  - Small bundle size
- **Leaflet/React-Leaflet**: Map implementation because:
  - Open-source and free to use
  - Lightweight and performant
  - Extensive documentation
  - Active community
  - Mobile-friendly

### Backend
- **Firebase**:
  - Authentication: Easy to implement, secure user management
  - Firestore: Real-time updates, scalable NoSQL database
  - Hosting: Simple deployment, good performance
  - Analytics: Built-in user analytics
  - Cost-effective for initial deployment

### State Management
- **React Context**: Used for:
  - Theme management (dark/light mode)
  - Authentication state
  - Simpler than Redux for our current needs
  - Easy to maintain and extend

## Technical Decisions and Rationale

### Recent Changes
1. **Removed Infinite Scrolling**:
   - Initially implemented for performance
   - Removed due to complexity with map marker synchronization
   - Current data volume doesn't justify pagination
   - May revisit with different implementation if data volume grows

2. **Map and List Synchronization**:
   - Fixed map position with scrollable list
   - Markers show all available sales
   - List items have corresponding numbered markers
   - Click-to-scroll functionality for better UX

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Component Structure**:
   - Page-based routing
   - Reusable components for common elements
   - Context providers for shared state
   - Utility functions for calculations

2. **Data Flow**:
   - Real-time updates from Firestore
   - Location-based filtering
   - Client-side distance calculations
   - Cached data for better performance

## Performance Considerations
- Map marker rendering optimization
- Location calculation efficiency
- Image optimization (planned)
- Caching strategies
- Bundle size management

## Security Measures
- User authentication
- Data validation
- Protected routes
- Environment variable management
- API key security

## Accessibility
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader support
- Responsive text sizing

## Future Considerations
1. **Scalability**:
   - May need to implement server-side pagination
   - Consider caching layer for frequent queries
   - Optimize for larger datasets

2. **Performance**:
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Add service worker for offline support
   - Consider server-side rendering

3. **Features**:
   - Advanced search and filtering
   - Social features
   - Monetization options
   - Mobile app version

## Known Issues
1. **Current**:
   - None at present

2. **Resolved**:
   - Fixed map marker synchronization with list
   - Resolved scroll behavior issues
   - Fixed dark mode consistency

## Development Workflow
- Feature branches
- Code review process
- Testing requirements
- Documentation updates
- Deployment process

This document will be updated as the project evolves.
